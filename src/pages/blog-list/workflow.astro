        <div>
          <h2>1. Research and Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            The foundation of any successful marketing campaign begins with
            research. At Brand Swift, we start by understanding your target
            audience, market trends, and competitors. By digging deep into your
            niche, we can uncover hidden opportunities and craft a strategy
            tailored to your brand’s unique needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Key elements of research include:</h3>

              behavioural traits.
